## Auth-Sample

To make sure the security between the interfaces of services, users can enable `RSA Authorizaiton` by simple configuration as below.

## Consumer Service

* Add dependence in pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId>
    <artifactId>handler-publickey-auth</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* Add handler chain in microservice.yaml:

```yaml
servicecomb:
  handler:
    chain:
      Consumer:
        default: auth-consumer
```

## Provider Service

* Add dependence in pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.servicecomb</groupId>
    <artifactId>handler-publickey-auth</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* Add handler chain in microservice.yaml:

```yaml
servicecomb:
  handler:
    chain:
      Consumer:
        default: auth-provider
```

## Sample Quick Start

Auth sample use `RestTemplate` to present RSA communication between provider and consumer.

* Start the ServiceComb/Service Center

   - [how to start the service center](http://servicecomb.apache.org/docs/products/service-center/install/)
   - make sure service center address is configured correctly in `microservice.yaml` file

```yaml
servicecomb:
 service:
   registry:
     address: http://127.0.0.1:30100		#service center address
```

* Start the auth-provider service

   - Start provider service by maven

     Compile the source code, and use `mvn exec` to execute the main class `AuthProviderMain`.

     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     cd auth-sample/auth-provider/
     mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.servicecomb.samples.auth.provider.AuthProviderMain"
     ```

   - Start provider service by IDE

     Import the project by InteliJ IDEA or Eclipse, then find `main` function `AuthProviderMain` of provider service and `RUN` it like any other Java program.

* Start the auth-consumer service

   Just like how to start auth-provider service. But the main class of auth-consumer service is `AuthConsumerMain`. 

```bash
cd auth-sample/auth-consumer/
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.servicecomb.samples.auth.consumer.AuthConsumerMain"
```

* How to verify
   On the producer side, the output should contain the following stuffs if the producer starts up successfully:
   1. *'swagger: 2.0 info: version: 1.0.0 ...'* means the producer generated swagger contracts
   2. *'rest listen success. address=0.0.0.0:8080'* means the rest endpoint is listening on port 8080
   
   On the consumer side, you can see the following outputs if the consumer can invoke the producer:
   1. *'Hello Authenticate'* means the consumer calls sayhi with name=Authenticate successfully
   2. *'Hello person ServiceComb/Authenticate'* means the consumer calls sayhello successfully
